Project Name:
- MaternaCare: Smart Pregnancy Belt  
  Description:
  MaternaCare is an innovative IoT-enabled wearable device designed to prioritize maternal and fetal health during pregnancy. This smart abdominal belt continuously monitors key health parameters such as maternal   heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and fetal movements. The data is transmitted in real-time to a companion Android app, offering timely alerts and health insights. Its offline functionality ensures    accessibility for expecting mothers in rural or low-connectivity areas, aiming to reduce health risks and improve pregnancy outcomes.

Features:

Continuous monitoring of maternal and fetal health parameters.
Real-time alerts in case of abnormal readings.
Offline functionality for seamless operation in low-connectivity areas.
User-friendly Android app with intuitive dashboards.
Bluetooth-enabled communication between the belt and the app.
How It Works:

Sensors embedded in the belt collect vital health data.
The ESP32 microcontroller processes the data and sends it via Bluetooth.
The Android app displays the data, generates alerts, and stores information locally or in the cloud.
Technologies Used:

Languages: Kotlin, C/C++
Hardware: ESP32, sensors (heart rate, temperature, pressure, and movement)
Frameworks: Android Jetpack
Databases: SQLite (offline data storage), Firebase (optional cloud backup)
APIs: Google APIs for notifications and location services
Goals:
MaternaCare aims to empower pregnant women by making health monitoring more accessible, reducing pregnancy-related risks, and providing a safer experience for both mother and baby.
